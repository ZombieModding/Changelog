# Shinny ZM 2.0
Welcome to the new and much shinier version of Zombie Modding

TL;DR In short, I'm now working on the ZM site, I've made lots of updates, fixes and changes but we're not done yet,
A large list of changes, Upgraded the server, Future plans are in the works, Thanks for sticking around or joining :D


Oh, Hello, You likely don't know who I am. I'm MiKeY sometimes better known as AoKMiKeY from the modding community.
I've been around for about 10 years in CoD Modding communities with the experience to back it up. When I spoke
to Darkflame about giving the Zombie Modding some much needed life we both agreed and here we are today. 

We've got a great update for the Website, unfortunately there is still a lot of work to go but this is 
a big dent in that list of things that we need to do for the Community. 

First things First, Happy Birthday ZM, You're now officially 8 Years old! Here is your present. A Face lift
and a promise to keep working on you. Well that sounds weird, here's all the things that I've spend months
doing. This list doesn't include half of the work but it's a top level overview :D

## Added
- Basically a complete redesign of Zombie Modding
    - New Logo,
        - This is by no means it's final form, I'd love some feedback from the community on how I could improve it.
    - A new shinny login page!
        - Soon to support Login with Google and the etc. We've hit a floor in SMF that we need to solve before we can enable this feature, but it's there, I promise!
    - A Redesigns Header and logo
        - A new search area
        - A new profile drop down 
        - More nav links!
    - A Updated and Cleaned up Forum Layout 
        - This includes Posts being cleaned up too.
    - A Complete redesigned Text Editor for creating posts
        - We are looking at implementing something much better than this in the future but for now making it look pretty should help fix some of the issues.
        - I may have broken the Smilies, Fix coming very soon. For now the :D system will work fine :), Sorry
    - Downloads
        - A new downloads add content page to ease the addition of new & old maps
        - A new design and layout
        - This update brings a new homepage for the Downloads system to show off all the latest content regardless of the section it's released in.
- Added a lovely Discord bot to post things to the Discord :D
    - The bot will post any new Topics and new Downloads to the Discord channels by itself
    - We're looking to have the member groups sync if you link you account but that's for the future
- Profanity Filter
    - Yes, it's not very good
    - Yes, you can trick it
    - Yes, It's not very FUCKING good.
    - We've added it to try and make the site "advertiser friendly" because google adsence are cunts.
    - Sorry :P 

## Changed
- A huge change has been made to the sites loading time by making all the files smaller!
    - This is a continual effort so we're expecting to improve the performance even more in the future
- Flex Box
    - This new css thing has allowed me to make the site Responsive Ready
    - We've got a lot of pages on ZM and with a limited amount of time I've not been able to update them all but we've got some sexy responsiveness on the main ones.
- We've upgraded SMF to 2.0.15
    - This is a much needed upgrade that brings a few very helpful things
    - Image proxy, This allows us to always be on a `HTTPS` url.
    - Lots of security fixes
    - PHP7.1
- Because of time only the most visited pages have been cleaned up. Although, as an exception to this rule we've cleaned up
    - Bookmarks,
    - Personal Messages 
    - Specific components like 
        - Lists,
        - Sidebars,
        - Dropdown Menus,
        - Some tables,
        - Search results, a tiny bit.

## Removed
- Some pretty useless Editor BBCode like FTP, Email and a few others
- A lot of the clutter from a lot of the pages. If you're finding it hard to find things then let me know and I'll improve it.
    - This includes moving buttons that are not required
    - Removing duplicate options that do the same thing 
    - Merging functionality in some cases
        
## Fixed
So so many things but here are some of the fun ones
- Being able to register...
- Youtube links 
- A lot of Random Javascript fails. 
- Most issues I've found whilst developing. there is to many to list honestly.

## Security
- A complete upgrade to a more secure password hashing algorithm.
  - Don't worry, none of your passwords will need to be changed, When you next login your password will be upgraded in the background :yay:
  - This is a Progressive upgrade meaning you are required to login for this update to affect your account. We have made futher security improvements to our server to mitigate any possible data breach :D
